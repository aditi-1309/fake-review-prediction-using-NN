This project proposes a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM model for detecting fake reviews. The model combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks to extract features from reviews and capture long-range dependencies between words. The model is evaluated on the Deceptive Opinion Spam Corpus (DOSC) dataset and shows promising results, outperforming other baseline models. The SELU activation function is found to perform best in the model.
